# Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life in C++.
This Game of Life was created for a school project. The lifeboard.h and lifeboard.cpp files contain methods of the lifeboard
class, which contains a two dimensional boolean vector that for each cell represents whether it is alive or dead. The life.cpp
file is the main driver.
